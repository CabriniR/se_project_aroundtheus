# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

**Intro**
This project is focused on building a responsive website, ensuring that all elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). The goal is to practice creating layouts that are adaptable to various resolutions and screen orientations. This project is more advanced than previous ones, so dedicating extra time to it is recommended to ensure a polished result.

**A description of the project and its functionality**
Responsive Layout: The website is designed to look great across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Interactive Buttons: Includes interactive features such as like buttons for each card and an edit button on the user profile.
Card Layout: A grid-based layout for destination cards that displays an image, title, and like button.

**Technologies and techniques used**
HTML: To structure the content of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the layout, ensuring responsiveness, and implementing CSS grid and flexbox for flexible layouts.
Media Queries: To create responsive breakpoints that adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
Figma: Used to follow the design prototype, ensuring the website closely matches the provided layout.
Image Optimization: Tools like TinyPNG are used to compress and optimize images for better website performance.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
